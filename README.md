# TinyGPT
TinyGPT is a lightweight implementation of the GPT language model designed for low-resource environments. Generates text with minimal computational requirements. <br>
This compact project harnesses the power of large-scale data to produce contextually relevant text.
Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "nanoGPT" and created as part of the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series. <br>This project provides a simple implementation of a generative language model.

## Usage

1. Open the [TinyGPT.ipynb](TinyGPT.ipynb) notebook in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Prepare your training data by placing it in a file named `data.txt` in the same directory as the notebook.

3. Modify the notebook's settings and hyperparameters as needed.

4. Run the notebook to train and use the model.

## Expected Result

The expected result of running this notebook is a language model that can generate text based on the patterns and structure of the training data. You can use the trained model to generate text, complete sentences, or even create simple stories. The quality of the generated text may vary depending on the size and quality of your training data and the chosen hyperparameters.
